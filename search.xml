Define <strong>multiplication</strong> as $\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = (c_0, c_1, \cdots )$ where $c_n = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i b_{n-i}$.</p><p>Speaking of algebraic structure, this set is actually an integral domain with unity be $(1, 0, 0, \cdots )$ (and this can be immediately seen from the properties illustrated below). But this is not important and it’s possible not to use any conclusions in abstract algebra in the following proofs, which is what I’ll do in this article.</p><p>Consider the notation $z := (0, 1, 0, 0, \cdots )$. By definition of multiplication we have $z^n = (0,0, \cdots 0, 1, 0, \cdots )$ where there are $n$ leading 0s before the 1, and $z^0$ be the multiplicative identity $(1, 0, 0, \cdots )$. It follows that $(a_0, a_1, a_2 \cdots ) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + \cdots = \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i z^i$, the latter being most renowned notation for <strong>formal power series</strong>.</p><p>Formally speaking, we define a <strong>formal power series</strong> to be a specific element in $\mathbb C^{\mathbb N_0}$, denoted by $\mathbf a = (a_0, a_1, a_2, \cdots )$ or $a(z) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i z^i$. We denote the set of all formal power series by $\mathbb C[[z]]$.</p><p>Note that this notation looks just like polynomials and our definition of multiplication and addition consists with that on polynomials.</p><p>We have only defined addition and multiplication of finite number of formal power series. <strong>Addition and multiplication of infinite number of formal power series</strong> are allowed if for any finite $n$, the coefficients of $z^n$ in the result can be written as sum of finite non-zero terms; in other words, we don’t allow <em>addition of infinite non-zero terms</em> (as the limit doesn’t always exist). For example, $\sum_{i=0}^\infty (1 + z)^i$ is illegal because the constant of the result is infinite 1s adding together; however $\prod_{i=0}^\infty (1 + z^{i} + z^{2i} + \cdots )$ is legal. Moreover, <strong>composition of two formal power series</strong> $f(g(z)) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty f_i (g(z))^i$ is allowed iff constant of $g(z)$ is 0.</p><p>In addition, we define the <strong>order</strong> of a formal power series as $d(\mathbf a) = \min \{ k \mid k \in \mathbb N_0, a_k \neq 0 \}$.</p><h3 id="Multiplicative-Inverse"><a href="#Multiplicative-Inverse" class="headerlink" title="Multiplicative Inverse"></a>Multiplicative Inverse</h3><p>Is the multiplication on formal power series invertible? In fact, we’ll see multiplicative inverse of $\mathbf a$ exists iff $a_0 \neq 0$, and is unique if it exists at all.</p><p>Define the <strong>multiplicative inverse</strong> of a formal power series $\mathbf a$ be formal power series $\mathbf b$ that satisfies $\mathbf a \mathbf b = 1 = (1, 0, 0, \cdots )$.</p><ul><li>If $a_0 = 0$, it easily follows that for any $\mathbf b$, $(\mathbf a \mathbf b)_0 = 0 \neq 1$, so $\mathbf a$ is irreversible.</li><li>If $a_0 \neq 0$, we can get a unique recursive expression of $\mathbf b$ immediately from the definition, namely $b_0 = \frac{1}{a_0}, b_n = - a_0^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n a_ib_{n-i}$, so $\mathbf a^{-1}$ exists and is unique.</li></ul><h3 id="Quotient-Field-and-Laurent-Series"><a href="#Quotient-Field-and-Laurent-Series" class="headerlink" title="Quotient Field and Laurent Series"></a>Quotient Field and Laurent Series</h3><p>The “quotient field of formal power series” is actually the set (actually it’s a field) of quotients of formal power series, formally defined as follows:</p><p>Consider the set $F = \{ \frac{a(z)}{b(z)} \mid a(z), b(z) \in \mathbb C[[z]]\}$ and define</p><ul><li>equivalence relation: we say two elements $\frac{a(z)}{b(z)}, \frac{c(z)}{d(z)}$ are <strong>equal</strong> iff $a(z) d(z) = b(z)c(z)$.</li><li>multiplication: $\frac{a(z)}{b(z)} \cdot \frac{c(z)}{d(z)} = \frac{a(z)c(z)}{b(z) d(z)}$</li><li>addition: $\frac{a(z)}{b(z)} + \frac{c(z)}{d(z)} = \frac{a(z)d(z) + b(z) c(z)}{b(z) d(z)}$</li></ul><p>For a invertible formal power series $b(z)$, note that $\frac{a(z)}{b(z)} = \frac{a(z) (b(z))^{-1}}{1}$ by definition.</p><p>Now consider Laurent series $p(z) = \sum_{n=k}^\infty a_nz^n$ where $k \in \mathbb Z, a_k \neq 0$. Note that a Laurrent series must be in $F$ because</p><ul><li>when $k \ge 0$, $p(z) = \frac{p(z)}{1} \in F$</li><li>when $k &lt; 0$, $p(z) = \frac{\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{n+k} z^n}{z^{-k}} \in F$</li></ul><p>Further more, we can actually say that any element in $F$ can be represented as a Laurent series:</p><ul><li>An observation is that if $a(z)$ is formal power series, $\frac{a(z)}{z^m}$ would then be a Laurent series.</li><li>For $\frac{a(z)}{b(z)}$, let $m = d(\mathbf b)$, then obviously $\frac{b(z)}{z^m}$ is invertible and $\frac{a(z)}{b(z)} = \frac{\frac{a(z)}{x^m}}{\frac{b(z)}{x^m}} = \frac{a(z) \cdot (\frac{b(z)}{z^m})^{-1}}{z^m}$ is Laurent series.</li></ul><p>Moreover, define the <strong>residue</strong> of a Laurent series $b(z)$ be the coefficient of $z^{-1}$, denoted by $Res(b(z))$.</p><h2 id="Derivative"><a href="#Derivative" class="headerlink" title="Derivative"></a>Derivative</h2><p>For formal  power series $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty f_n z^n$, define its derivative $(Df)(z) = f’(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty f_{n+1}(n+1) z^n$. One can see this definition consists with that on polynomials.</p><p>We’ll prove the following rules for calculating derivative of formal power power series:</p><ol><li>$(f(z) + g(z))’ = f’(z) + g’(z)$</li><li>$(f(z)g(z))’ = f’(z)g(z) + g’(z)f(z)$</li><li>$f^k(z) = kf^{k-1}(z)f’(z)$</li><li>$(f(g(z)))’ = f’(g(z))\cdot g’(z)$</li></ol><p>pf 1.: omitted.</p><p>pf 2.: $(f(z) g(z) )’ = \sum_{i\ge0, j\ge 0, i+j&gt;0} f_ig_j (i+j)z^{i+j-1}$ and $f’(z)g(z) + g’(z)f(z) = (\sum_{i &gt; 0, j\ge 0} f_ig_j\cdot i \cdot  z^{i+j- 1}) + (\sum_{i\ge 0, j &gt; 0} f_i g_j \cdot j \cdot z^{i+j-1}) = \sum_{i\ge 0, j\ge 0, i+ j &gt; 0}f_i g_j (i+j)z^{i+j-1} =(f(z)g(z))’$</p><p>pf 3.: see $f^k(z)$ as $f(z) \cdot f(z) \cdot \cdots$ and by applying rule 2. we are done.</p><p>pf 4.: $(f(g(z)))’ = (\sum_{i=0}^\infty f_i g^i(z))’ = \sum_{i=0}^\infty f_i  \cdot i \cdot g^{i-1}(z) \cdot g’(z) = f’(g(z)) g’(z)$</p><blockquote><p>remark: Up to now, we have shown the addition, multiplication, composition and derivative on formal power series all consist with that on polynomials. This means we can often write a formal power series as “the Taylor series of some function”, which is called the closed form of this formal power series. Operations of the above 4 types on this function is equivalent to operations on its Taylor series, so operations on the closed form (obeying the same rules as corresponding numerical functions) are equivalent to operations on formal power series. This is very useful in some problems.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Exponential-and-Logarithm"><a href="#Exponential-and-Logarithm" class="headerlink" title="Exponential and Logarithm"></a>Exponential and Logarithm</h2><p>Define $\exp (z): = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n!}, \log (1 + z) := \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{z^n}{n}$. In this context, $\exp(z), \log (1 + z)$ are defined to be two very special formal power series, and they actually possesses similar properties as the exponential function and logarithm function do, which are</p><ol><li>$\frac{1}{\exp(z)} = \exp(-z)$</li><li>$(\exp(x))^k = \exp(kx), k\in \mathbb Z^+$</li><li>$D(\exp(z)) = \exp (z)$</li><li>$D(\log (1 + z) )=\frac{1}{1 + z}$</li><li>$\log(\exp (z) ) = z$</li></ol><p>pf 1.: $\exp(z) \cdot \exp(-z) = (\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}) (\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{x^n}{n!}) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} \sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i} (-1)^i = 1$</p><p>pf 2.: $(\exp(z))^k = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n!}\sum_{i_1 + i_2 + \cdots i_k = n, i_t \ge 0}  \binom{n}{i_1, i_2, \cdots i_k} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n!} \cdot k^n = \sum_{n = 0}^ \infty \frac{(zk)^n }{n!} = \exp(kz)$</p><p>pf 3. and 4.: Omitted (just follow the definition!)</p><p>pf 5.: Because $D(\log (\exp(z))) = D\log (\exp z) \cdot D \exp (z) = \frac{1}{\exp z} \cdot \exp z = 1$, we know $[z^1] (\log (\exp(z))) = 1,[z^n] (\log (\exp(z))) = 0(n&gt;0)$ and by definition we know constant in $\log (\exp(z)) = 0$.</p><h2 id="Inverse-Function"><a href="#Inverse-Function" class="headerlink" title="Inverse Function"></a>Inverse Function</h2><p>Define composition of two formal power series $f, g$ to be $(f \circ g) (z) = f(g(z)) := \sum_{i=0}^\infty f_i (g(z))^i$. By definition you see composition is associative.</p><p>For two formal power series $f(z), g(z)$ with zero coefficient for $z^0$ and non-zero coefficient for $z^1$, if $f(g(z)) = z$, we say $f(z)$ is the <strong>inverse function</strong> of $g(z)$, or the inverse in the sense of function composition. This inverse has two very good properties:</p><ol><li>For any $g(z)$ with zero coefficient for $z^0$ and non-zero coefficient for $z^1$, this inverse exists and is unique.<ol><li>pf: Let’s try to find such $f$. Obviously $f_1 = \frac{1}{g_1}$; expand $f\circ g$ by definition we have $0 = [z^n] f(g(z)) = f_1 \cdot ([z^n]g(z)) + f_2 ([z^n]g^2(z)) + \cdots + f_n ([z^n]g^n(z)) $. Thus, $f_n$ can always be uniquely determined through recursion.</li></ol></li><li><p>This inverse is symmetric. In other words, $f(g(z))  = z \Leftrightarrow g(f(z)) = z$.</p><ol><li>pf: Let the unique inverse of $f(z)$ be $g_1(z)$. Then $(f \circ g ) ( z) = z \Rightarrow (g_1 \circ f \circ g ) ( z) = g_1(z) \Rightarrow ((g_1 \circ f ) \circ g)(z) = g_1(z) \Rightarrow (Id \circ g(z)) = g_1(z) \Rightarrow g(z) = g_1(z)$.</li></ol><p>Next, we’ll introduce a method to calculate inverse of a formal power series efficiently.</p></li></ol><h3 id="Important-Lemma"><a href="#Important-Lemma" class="headerlink" title="Important Lemma"></a>Important Lemma</h3><p>Let $w(z)$ be a Laurent series. We claim that</p><ol><li>$Res(w’(z)) = 0$<ol><li>it follows immediately by definition of derivative.</li></ol></li><li>$Res(w’(z)/w(z)) = d(w(z))$, where $d(w(z))$ stands for the order of $w(z)$<ol><li>$\frac{w’(z)}{w(z)} = \frac{1}{z^k}\cdot \frac{\sum_{n=k-1}^\infty (n+1) w_{n+1}z^{n}}{\sum_{n=0}^\infty w_{n+k}z^n} = \frac{1}{z^k} \cdot (\sum_{n=k-1}^\infty (n+1)w_{n+1}z^n) \cdot (\sum_{n=0} w_{n+k}z^n)^{-1}$, the term with the smallest degree on the RHS is exactly $\frac{1}{z^k} \cdot (k w_k z^{k-1}) \cdot (w_k)^{-1} = k \cdot z^{-1}$.</li></ol></li></ol><h3 id="Lagrange-Inversion-Theorem"><a href="#Lagrange-Inversion-Theorem" class="headerlink" title="Lagrange Inversion Theorem"></a>Lagrange Inversion Theorem</h3><p>Here we’ll use a bit idea of Lagrange inversion theorem and the special case of the complete conclusion.</p><p>Let $W(z) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty  w_iz^i$ be a formal power series with zero coefficient for $z^0$ and non-zero coefficient for $z^1$, $Z(w) = c_1w + c_2 w^2 + \cdots$ be another formal power series and $Z(W(z)) = z$.

This implies $x$ is rational and the denominator is a divisor of $10^k$.</li></ul></li><li>Thus, we get to the conclusion that $x$ has 2 different decimal presentations iff $x$ is rational and the only primes that divide the denominator are 2 or 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Construct-the-bijection-between-mathbb-C-and-mathbb-R"><a href="#Construct-the-bijection-between-mathbb-C-and-mathbb-R" class="headerlink" title="Construct the bijection between $\mathbb C$ and $\mathbb R$"></a>Construct the bijection between $\mathbb C$ and $\mathbb R$</h2><p>One can see that $\mathbb R \approx \mathbb Z \times [0, 1)$ (consider the isomorphism $\phi: x \mapsto ([x], x - [x])$). Then $\mathbb C \approx \mathbb R^2  \approx \mathbb Z^2 \times [0, 1)^2 \approx \mathbb Z \times [0, 1)^2$. This means if we can find some bijection $f$ between $[0, 1)^2$ and $[0,1 )$ then we are done.</p><p>Consider the decimal expansion for $(x, y) \in [0, 1)^2$ where $x = 0.d_1d_2 \cdots, y = 0.c_1c_2\cdots$. A naive construction of $f$ is</p>$$f: (0.d_1d_2d_3 \cdots, 0.c_1c_2c_3\cdots )\mapsto 0.d_1c_1d_2c_2d_3c_3\cdots$$<p>However, this mapping is not well-defined, as it maps $(0.0999999999\cdots , 0), (0.1, 0)$ to different numbers although they are essentially the same point. The problem arises from the 2 different decimal presentations of the same number. From previous discussion, we know infinitely repeating 9 is the only case that this construction fails.</p><p>What if we add a constraint that, if there are multiple representations possible, we only use the $000 \cdots$ version to calculate the image of $f$? (You can also choose $99999\cdots$ version, and use $0$ as “marker” in the next paragraph. Here I take just $000\cdots$ for illustration) This will make $f$ well-defined and injective, but still not surjective, because numbers such as $0.0909090909 \cdots$ will have no preimage. </p><p>Note that the problem with $f^{-1}$ is essentially that, it could map a decimal expansion without repeating 9 to an expansion containing repeating 9. What about, instead of working with discrete digits, we work with digit blocks that never end with 9? For example, $0.32394999799099992\cdots$ would be seen as $0.(3)(2)(3)(94)(9997)(990)(9992)\cdots$, and $f(0.(3)(993)(0), 0.(4)(93)(92)) = 0.(3)(4)(993)(93)(0)(92)$. In this way the image contains infinitely repeating 9 iff its preimage does and vice versa. Then with the limitation that we only use $00000\cdots$ (instead of $99999\cdots$) version of decimal presentation, $f$ turns out a well-defined bijection and we’re done.</p>]]></content>
